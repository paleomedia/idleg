# Scrum Plan for IDleg.info project

Development sprints for the Fall 2015 semester are recorded on a public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/0jSicfSF/idleg-info-development-sprints) where anyone (you might need a Trello login to comment...) can vote on features, suggest new features and track our progress. The board is also replicated below. Numbers in parenthesis indicate mythical person hour points for a task.

This optimistic schedule represents some of the tasks I hope to learn and deploy this semester toward building a fully functional idleg.info site. You may notice that I've included some of my writing and survey tasks as well, as this project is also part of my inderdisciplinary master's degree in "data journalism." Feel free to suggest some new features or leave comments on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/0jSicfSF/idleg-info-development-sprints).
